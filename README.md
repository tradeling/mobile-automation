# Project Details

## Framework

### Mobile Events

- All the actions for mobile are defined in `MobileActions` class.

- Log methods available in Logger class: `logPass(description)`, `logFail(description, exception)`

## Page Objects

- Create one screen as a class and add locators to the same class
- Each locator is declared as of type `MobileElement` which is generic to `IOSElement` and `AndroidElement`
- Each locator should be annotated with `@iOSXCUITFindBy` and `@AndroidFindBy`
- `actions` a thread safe object of `MobileActions` is used to access the Mobile Events in the page objects

## Test Cases

### Test Class

- Each test class contains methods annotated with `@Test` i.e. Test cases
- Test class should be extended with class `EnvironmentSetup` to inherit the driver and also to handle the TestNG hooks.
- The naming convention for the test cases is like `register_new_buyer`

### Test Case Management

- For test case management we are using TestNG
- Define the test cases inside the `test` tag of testng
- Each test tag of testng will have it's own driver and require platform to be passed throught attribute `deviceType`
